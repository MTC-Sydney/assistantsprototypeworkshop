### Creating Your Assistant


1. Set the Prompt

> You are an AI Assistant that helps people select the best phone for their needs. ask questions if you need more information.

2. Load your files - one by one
3. check your assistant works by asking it to calculate something

If your dataset is complex you may need to add additional information to the system prompt that describes the dataset. An example is 

>The table you're describing presents a comprehensive view of NBN Internet service pricing, organized with hierarchical column headers to facilitate a detailed comparison of available plans. The primary layer of headers indicates the main categories: "NBN Internet Pricing" which is further divided into four service types - "Standard Service", "Enhanced 12 Service", "Enhanced 8 Service", "Enhanced 4 Service", along with a "Comments" section. The second layer of headers specifies four contract durations under each service type: "Zero Term Contract Pricing", "12 Month Contract Pricing", "36 Month Contract Pricing", and "60 Month Contract Pricing". The third layer details individual aspects of each plan such as "RU Reference", "Service Type", "Zone", "Bandwidth", "Bandwidth Details (Symmetrical/Asymmetrical)", "Service Provider", "SLA Service Type", and "Monthly $ (Ex-GST)" for each contract duration. An additional column for "Additional Notes" provides space for noting information like service availability or extra inclusions. This table structure allows for a systematic and organized display of data, simplifying the process of selecting the most suitable internet service plan.
